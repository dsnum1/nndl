## Single Neuron
HardCoded/single_neuron.py contains a parent class that implements a single neuron. 
A neuron is a fundamental element of all neural nets. A typical neuron takes a weighted sum of all its input signals. This sum is a single number that is input into an activation function. The activation function computes the final output. In the code provided, you can define a neural net using the Neuron class.
``` n = Neuron(w = [a,b,c,..], b = x )```

w means weights. It is a list which stores the weight that every ith input will be multiplied with
